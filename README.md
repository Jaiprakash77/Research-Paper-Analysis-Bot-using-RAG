```
Access at: `http://localhost:8501`

#### CLI Version
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📖 Usage

1. **Upload PDF**: Click "Browse files" or drag & drop in the sidebar
2. **Wait for Processing**: The app will:
   - Load PDF pages
   - Split into chunks (500 characters each)
   - Create embeddings using Ollama
   - Build FAISS vector store
3. **Ask Questions**: 
   - Use quick question buttons for common queries
   - Type custom questions in the text input
   - Click "Send 🚀" to submit
4. **Get Answers**: Receive accurate, context-based responses with:
   - Academic tone appropriate for research papers
   - Specific findings and details from the paper
   - Structured responses (lists, steps, explanations)
   - Clear indication when information isn't available

### Example Questions

- "What is the abstract of this paper?"
- "What methodology was used in this research?"
- "What are the main findings and results?"
- "Who are the authors of this paper?"
- "What are the key contributions?"
- "What are the limitations mentioned?"
- "What future work is suggested?"
- "What datasets were used?"

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Configuration

Key parameters in code:
```python
chunk_size = 500          # Characters per chunk
chunk_overlap = 100       # Overlap between chunks (20%)
k = 6                     # Number of chunks to retrieve
fetch_k = 20              # Candidates for MMR algorithm
temperature = 0           # Deterministic responses (no randomness)
max_history = 5           # Conversation pairs to remember
```

## 🧪 Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Python 3.8+** | Programming language |
| **LangChain** | RAG framework & orchestration |
| **Ollama** | Local LLM inference |
| **Llama 3.2** | Language model (3B parameters) |
| **FAISS** | Vector similarity search |
| **Streamlit** | Web UI framework |
| **PyPDF** | PDF text extraction |

## 🔧 Configuration Options

Modify these in the code for different behavior:

- **Change LLM Model**: Update `model="llama3.2"` in `OllamaLLM()` and `OllamaEmbeddings()`
  - Try: `llama3.1`, `mistral`, `phi3`, `gemma2`, etc.
- **Adjust Chunk Size**: Modify `chunk_size` in `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
  - Smaller chunks (300-400): More precise but may miss context
  - Larger chunks (800-1000): More context but less precise
- **Change Retrieval Count**: Update `k` value in retriever configuration
  - Higher k (8-10): More context but slower
  - Lower k (3-4): Faster but may miss relevant info
- **Modify Temperature**: Change `temperature` parameter
  - 0: Deterministic (same answer every time) - Current setting
  - 0.3-0.5: Slightly varied but still focused
  - 0.7-1.0: More creative/varied responses

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Ollama not responding?**
```bash
# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# In another terminal, verify model is available
ollama list

# If model not found, pull it
ollama pull llama3.2
```

**Out of memory errors?**
- Use a smaller model: `ollama pull llama3.2:1b`
- Reduce chunk count: Set `k=3` instead of `k=6`
- Close other applications to free up RAM

**PDF not processing?**
- Ensure PDF is not password-protected
- Check file size (limit: 200MB)
- Verify PDF contains extractable text (not just scanned images)
- Try re-uploading the file

**Slow response times?**
- First query is always slower (model loading)
- Reduce `fetch_k` from 20 to 10
- Use a smaller/faster model like `phi3`

## 🎯 Dual Interface

This project includes **two interfaces** for different use cases:

### Streamlit UI ([`app.py`](app.py))
- **For**: End users, demos, presentations
- **Features**: 
  - Visual PDF upload with drag & drop
  - Chat interface with message history
  - Quick question buttons
  - Document statistics (chunks, conversations)
  - Clear chat history functionality
  - Real-time processing status
- **Run**: `streamlit run app.py`

### CLI Version ([`main.py`](main.py))
- **For**: Developers, debugging, automation
- **Features**:
  - Command-line interaction
  - Text-based Q&A
  - Debug output with chunk previews
  - No dependencies on web frameworks
  - Lightweight and fast
- **Run**: `python main.py`

Both share the same core RAG logic and produce identical results.
